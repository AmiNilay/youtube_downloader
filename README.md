2. Enter a YouTube URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17vlZqtNIOc`).
3. Select a stream:

### Troubleshooting for Users
- **Video Unavailable**: Some videos may be private, deleted, or restricted (e.g., region-locked or age-restricted). Try a different video.
- **Download Fails**: Ensure your internet connection is stable. If the issue persists, report it via GitHub Issues (see "Contributing" below).
- **Test Video**: Try a publicly available video like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` to test the app.


## For Developers: Modifying or Running the Code Locally

If youâ€™re a developer who wants to modify this app, contribute to it, or run it locally on your machine, follow the instructions below.

### Features
- Download YouTube videos in MP4 format.
- Extract and download audio from YouTube videos in MP3 format.
- Download video thumbnails.
- User-friendly web interface with error handling and feedback.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **FFmpeg**: Required for MP3 conversion. Install it and add it to your system PATH.
  - **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH.
  - **Linux**: Run `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.
  - **macOS**: Run `brew install ffmpeg`.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-downloader.git
   cd youtube-downloader
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
   If this command fails, install FFmpeg and add it to your PATH.

### Usage
1. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
3. Enter a YouTube URL, select a stream (e.g., Audio (mp3) or a video resolution), and click "Download".

### Deployment
To host this app online (e.g., on Render, Heroku, or a VPS), follow these steps:
1. Ensure `requirements.txt` is included in your repository.
2. Use a platform like Render:
   - Create a new Web Service on Render and connect your GitHub repository.
   - Set the runtime to Python.
   - Add a build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Add a start command: `gunicorn app:app`.
   - Note: You may need to include FFmpeg in your deployment. For Render, use a `Dockerfile` like this:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM python:3.9-slim

     # Install FFmpeg
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg

     # Set working directory
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy project files
     COPY . .

     # Install Python dependencies
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

     # Expose port
     EXPOSE 5000

     # Run the app
     CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]

3. Once deployed, update this `README.md` with the live URL in the "For End-Users" section.

### Troubleshooting for Developers
- **FFmpeg Not Found**: If you see an error about FFmpeg, ensure itâ€™s installed and in your PATH.
- **Video Unavailable**: Some videos may require a GVS PO Token due to YouTube restrictions. See [yt-dlp PO Token Guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide) for more information.
- **Logs**: Check `error.log` in the project directory for detailed error messages.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed as per `requirements.txt`.

### Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main Flask application.
- `templates/index.html`: The web interface.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes temporary files like `downloads/` and `error.log`.
- `Dockerfile` (optional): For deploying on platforms like Render that require FFmpeg.
